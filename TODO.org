* Certain
1. [ ] Multi-machine use - user specifies a machine name; the destination path finally becomes =<destination path>/<machine name>/<source path>/=
2. Progress bar
3. Rename "destination" to "prefix", to clarify its use; I want the user to only have to specify it once per backup device.

   How about something like...
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     '((:prefix "/media/anon/my-disk/"
        :sources ("~/.emacs.d/"
                  "~/Documents/")))
   #+END_SRC

* Maybe
1. Better default value for =rsync-max-procs=? Some way to determine the ideal value, maybe using number of CPU cores and/or network bandwidth?
